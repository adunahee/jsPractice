functions are blocks of code that you will run more than once and want to be able to refer to later in
  repeatable
  recallable
```
function fillMugWith(drink)p{
  place mug in appropriate spot
  use drink's receptical to fill mug
}

fillMugWith(coffee);

function fillMugWith(ingredientOne, ingredientTwo, ingredientThree){
  fill with ingredientOne
  fill with ingredientTwo
  fill with ingredientThree
}

fillMugWith(water, coffee, tomatoJuice);

```
return in a function sets the value of the function after running it.
eg
function returner(){
  return true;
}

console.log (returner);
// will log true

you can use return with console log
parameters define what you can pass to a function
arguments are what you pass to the function
  eg
  function area(heightParameter, widthParameter){
    let area = heightParameter * widthParameter;
    return console.log(area);
  }
  let argumentOne = 1;
  let argumentTwo = 2;
  function area(argumentOne, argumentTwo);

  Practical Teamwork: Imposter Syndrome
    difficulty internalizing accomplishments
    feels risk of being labeled a fraud
    leads to demotivation and hiding ignorance


    avoid comparison with others, in failure and accomplishments
    honestly acknowledge your accomplishments
    find the lessons in your mistakes
    abandon guilt of failure
    engage with others about your challenges

As a learner be kind, curious, and self-aware
